## 1.2.0
#### Some changes based on user feedback and some additional features.
* Added [Risk Of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/) as a dependency.
* The camera offset can now be configured. **You can control this in real time with Risk of Options in-game.**
* The character now becomes slightly transparent in combat. You can configure the transparency in and out of combat in the mod's configs. **You can control this in real time with Risk of Options in-game.**
* The default camera position is no longer set up like a shoulder camera.
* Added [NoSelfPing](https://thunderstore.io/package/Xan/NoSelfPing/) as a dependency to resolve the issue with being unable to ping things. It's part of why I actually made NoSelfPing in the first place.
* Increased the hitscan angle and the maximum distance of Bind to make hits feel much more consistent and work from a longer range.
* Bind now saps health from the target. The amount has been added to the mod's configuration. Its default value is 5%.
* Bind now has a configurable duration for its application of Nullify. There is a separate configuration for bosses to balance it against bosses.
* Fury now replaces Spike with a new sub-skill called "Perforate" that makes you fire much faster, but with less projectiles per burst. The net damage per second is much higher, and it becomes easier to deal with swarms. Spray and pray.
* Some settings have had their defaults changed. It is recommended that you review your settings if you want to try the new defaults.

## 1.0.1
#### Yeah, I guess that was my fault.
* Fixed a reflection exception preventing the mod from loading on some clients.
