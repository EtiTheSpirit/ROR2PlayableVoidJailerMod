# Void Jailer Player Character

This mod allows you to play as a Void Jailer. It appends two new abilities for its Utility and Special slots. You can see those down below.

**As usual, balance is not perfect with this mod, so it gives you the option to configure just about every stat associated with the character and its abilities.** If you have any suggestions, *please* let me know! You can find me in the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord under the nickname "Xan" `Xan // Eti#1760`.

Upon death, **Reave** is triggered, firing a small black hole that instantly kills all monsters *and players* caught within. [The Void Jailer is immune to Void Fog, and will not take damage within Void Seeds or when outside of a focus.] |
| ![Spike Icon](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/Images/blob/main/VoidJailerMod/Spike.png?raw=true) | Spike              | Primary   | Fire a burst of Void Darts from your claw, dealing [12]x[125]% damage. Damage is boosted by [200]% on targets that are **Nullified** or **Tethered**.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ![Bind Icon](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/Images/blob/main/VoidJailerMod/Bind.png?raw=true)                | Bind               | Secondary | Latch onto an enemy from a distance, applying a force that tries to pull them directly in front of you. Deals [80]% damage and inflicts **Nullify** for [10] seconds ([5] on bosses). Heals [15]% maximum health.                                                                                                                                  |
| ![Dive Icon](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/Images/blob/main/VoidJailerMod/Dive2.png?raw=true)               | Dive               | Utility   | Propel yourself through the void at [400]% movement speed for [1] second, healing [10]% maximum health. Gain **Immunity** and **Invisiblity** while away.                                                                                                                                                         |

Replaces **Spike** with **Perforate**. Perforate dramatically increases the firerate and damage of **Spike**, altering it to fire [3] Void Darts that each do [300]% of Spike's total damage. The firerate is changed to a linear scale of 2.5 shots per second, per 1 unit of attack speed. |
